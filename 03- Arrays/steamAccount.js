// As a gamer, Peter has Tseam Account. He loves to buy new games. You are given Peter's account with all of his games-> strings, separated by space. Until you receive "Play!" you will be receiving commands which Peter does with his account.

// You may receive the following commands:

// 路 Install {game} - add the game at the last position in the account, but only if it isn't installed already.

// 路 Uninstall {game} - delete the game if it exists.

// 路 Update {game} - update the game if it exists and place it in the last position.

// 路 Expansion {game}-{expansion} - check if the game exists and insert after it the expansion in the following format: "{game}:{expansion}";

//UNDERSTANDING:
// I'll receive list of commands, until command Play

//SUBTASKS:
// 1- Separate game with space
// 2- If command is not a Play, continue with others

//RESEARCH:
// - How can I separate arrays with space

//PSEUDO- CODE:
